The first step is to download the en\_windows\_8\_x64\_dvd\_915440.iso file from the official Microsoft website. You can use this link[^2^] to access the download page. You will need to select the edition of Windows 8 that matches your product key from the drop-down menu. Then, you will need to verify your language and click on the "Confirm" button. After that, you will see two links for downloading the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows 8. Since you are looking for the en\_windows\_8\_x64\_dvd\_915440.iso file, you should click on the link for the 64-bit version. The download size is about 3.3 GB, so make sure you have enough space and a stable internet connection.
  
## Create a bootable USB or DVD from the en\_windows\_8\_x64\_dvd\_915440.iso file
  
After downloading the en\_windows\_8\_x64\_dvd\_915440.iso file, you will need to create a bootable USB or DVD from it. This will allow you to install Windows 8 on your computer by booting from the media. You will need a blank USB flash drive or a blank DVD (and a DVD burner) with at least 4 GB of space for this step.
  
There are several tools that can help you create a bootable USB or DVD from an ISO file, but we recommend using the Windows USB/DVD Download Tool[^2^] from Microsoft. This tool is easy to use and compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10. To use this tool, you will need to follow these steps:
  
1. Download and install the Windows USB/DVD Download Tool from this link[^2^].
2. Run the tool and browse for the en\_windows\_8\_x64\_dvd\_915440.iso file that you downloaded in the previous step.
3. Select whether you want to create a USB device or a DVD as your media type.
4. If you choose USB device, plug in your USB flash drive and select it from the drop-down menu. If you choose DVD, insert a blank DVD into your DVD burner and select it from the drop-down menu.
5. Click on "Begin copying" and wait for the tool to copy the files from the ISO file to your USB or DVD.
6. When the process is complete, you will have a bootable USB or DVD with Windows 8 installation files on it.

## Install and activate Windows 8 using the product key
  
Now that you have created a bootable USB or DVD with Windows 8 installation files on it, you can use it to install Windows 8 on your computer. You will need to boot your computer from the media that you created in the previous step. To do this, you may need to change the boot order in your BIOS settings or use a boot menu option. For more details on how to boot from a USB or DVD, you can refer to this guide[^1^].
  
Once you boot from the media, you will see a Windows Setup screen where you can choose your language, time and currency format, and keyboard or input method. Click on "Next" and then on "Install now". You will be prompted to enter your product key
