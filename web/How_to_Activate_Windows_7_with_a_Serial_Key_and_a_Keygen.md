## What is Windows 7?
 
Windows 7 is a popular operating system released by Microsoft in 2009. It has various editions, such as Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate. Each edition has different features and functionalities. Windows 7 is known for its user-friendly interface, improved performance, and enhanced security. However, Microsoft ended its support for Windows 7 on January 14, 2020. This means that you will not receive any updates or patches for Windows 7 anymore. Therefore, it is recommended to upgrade to Windows 10 or another supported operating system.
 
## Why Do You Need to Activate Windows 7?
 
Activating Windows 7 is necessary to verify that your copy of Windows is genuine and not pirated. It also unlocks all the features and benefits of Windows 7. If you do not activate Windows 7 within 30 days of installation, you will see a message on your desktop saying "This copy of Windows is not genuine". You will also experience reduced functionality, such as limited personalization options, frequent reminders to activate, and black wallpaper. To avoid these problems, you need to activate Windows 7 with a valid serial key or a keygen.
